    <h1 style="font-size: 90px; color: white">About Me</h1>
    <h1 style="color:white;">My Background</h1>
    <p style="color: white;">My name is Hoang Anh Vo, but I go by Oliver Vo. I was born in Australia and both my parents are Vietnamese. At home I speak English, Vietnamese and sometimes “Vinglish” which is a mix of Vietnamese and English </p>

    <h1 style="color: white;">My Education</h1>
    <p style="color: white;">I have been to many schools in my life. My first school was Creekside College which I studied at from kindergarten to year one. Afterwards I moved to Brookside College because it was closer to my house at the time and I studied there until year three. I then moved to Mowbray College and studied there until year four. Before I could finish year four at Mowbray, the school shut down and I was forced to move. I studied at Yarraville West Primary school starting in the middle of year four and until year six. Yarraville West only goes up to year six, so after that I moved back to Brookside where I studied there until the end of year eight. I passed an entrance exam for a select entry school called Suzanne Cory High School (basically dollar store Melbourne High) where I studied until year twelve and graduated from. After that I now study at RMIT. </p>
    <h1 style="color: white;">My spare time and hobbies</h1>
    <p style="color: white;">I love watching anime and reading manga. My favourite anime is Mob Psycho 100 and my favourite manga is Kingdom. I really like watching animation and then discussing to my friend on what makes the/a show good, whether its characters, themes, story and ect.</p>
    <img src="images/anime.jpg" alt="">
    <p style="color: white;">When I was in highschool, I used to do Taekwondo and cross country and I was very into fitness, but during VCE I got lazy and washed up, and I’ve been trying to get back into fitness after I graduated from High School.</p>

    <img src="Images/TKD 3.jpg"width="280" height="430"alt="">
    <p style="color: white;">I like playing games. The games I like are rpg and dungeon games. I play a lot of pokemon, Moonlighter, Soul Knight and my favourite video game: undertale. I also play a couple of multiplayer games with some of my friends such as Super Smash Bros ultimate and Minecraft. I also love tabletop games and card games, Coup and Unstable Unicorns are some of my favourites.</p>

    <p style="color: white;"> I do not have pets although I would like a shiba inu.</p>
    <img src="images/shiba.jpg" alt="">

    <h1 style="font-size: 90px; color: white;">Interest in IT</h1>
    <p style="color: white;">I am a very logical person but I also consider myself very creative and imaginative, and I think IT will allow me to combine logical and creative skills. Although I have never been good with computers, I have always been interested and curious about them. Whenever I learn something new about computers either from the internet or from a friend who is a computer wiz, I would be amazed and be like “wow I didn’t even know that was possible.” IT requires constant learning and education as there is constant new developments. I also enjoy helping my mum and my grandmother with computers and IT problems to the best of my limiting abilities. Learning IT would give me the knowledge and skills to help make other’s jobs easier.</p>
    <h1 style="color: white;">When did my interest in IT start?</h1>
    <p style="color: white;">When I was young I played a lot of minecraft and would watch lots of mod showcases which made me want to get mods myself. I would usually ask my father to get the mods for me, but after he moved to Sydney, I learned how to get mods for minecraft and other games via youtube. Being able to get mods made me feel very accomplished and I felt badass at the time which sounds silly thinking about it now, and I think that had an influence on my interest in IT.</p>
    <p style="color: white;">Playing a lot of games in my childhood has made me very interested in them. Becoming a game developer would be very nice, but anything that has to do with bringing ideas to life through IT is very interesting to me.</p>
    <h1 style="color: white;">My experience in IT</h1>
    <p style="color: white;">Prior to enrolling in Bachelors of Information Technology, I had little to no experience in IT, however after enrolment, I learned python from a youtube channel called “programming with Mosh.” I found Python very fun to play around with.</p>
    <h1 style="color: white">Why did I choose to come to RMIT?</h1>
    <p style="color: white;">The reason why I chose RMIT is because of location, reputation and friends. First of all, RMIT is right near Melbourne Central which is my favourite place in the city. Not only is it easy to travel to but it is also very convenient with all the food, shops and services. From what I have heard, RMIT is one of the best universities for IT and a friend of mine also recommended me to study there for that reason. A couple of my close friends from highschool enrol in RMIT and I want to keep in touch with them</p>
    <h1 style="color: white;">What do I expect to learn during my studies?</h1>
    <p style="color: white;">During my studies, I am expecting to learn a programming language, communication skills, analysis skills and business skills. Programming is definitely going to be in the program  because I would need to know how to tell a computer to do certain things. Soft skills such as communication skills are likely to be taught since I would be working in teams during and after my studies. Analysis skills are important since I would need to know what I am working with  in IT.</p>

    <h1 style="font-size: 90px; color: white;">Ideal Job</h1>
    <p style="color: white;">Job: Game Developer</p>
    <p style="color: white;">Position:Intermediate C++/Unreal Game Developer</p>
    <p style="color: white;">Company:CerebralFix</p>
    <h1 style="color: white;">Job Ad</h1>
    <img src="Images/job 1.png"width="860" height="560" alt="">
    <p> </p>
    <img src="Images/job 2.png"width="860" height="800" alt="">
    <p> </p>
    <img src="Images/job 3.png"width="860" height="450" alt="">
    <h1 style="color: white;">Description</h1>
    <p style="color: white;">The position is Intermediate C++/Unreal Game Developer for the company CerebralFix. I will be working with a team of developers and researchers to make all kinds of games. Some of the projects will use virtual reality technology, projection mapping and ect.</p>
    <h1 style="color: white;">Appeal</h1>
    <p style="color: white;">The position as Intermediate C++/Unreal Game Developer appeals to me because of three main reasons: location, I love video games and I work best in a team.</p>
    <p style="color: white;">The location is convenient as it is in the Melbourne CBD which is easy to travel quickly. Despite the company that offers this job, CerebralFix is based in New Zealand, the Job Ad clearly states that I would be working in Melbourne.</p>
    <p style="color: white;">I love video games and it would be nice if my job is all about them. I not only love playing games, but also love analysing the story and character designs of games. Because of this, I would love to bring a good story and a well designed character to life in a game.</p>
    <p style="color: white;">The job description explains how I would work in a team. I would consider myself as an extrovert as I gain my energy from being with people. Working by myself is very exhausting for me and I could not stay productive for an extended amount of time. I find that working with other people gives me the energy and motivation to work harder, faster and more productive as well as make my job more enjoyable than if I was working alone.</p>
    <h1 style="color: white;">Skills I need</h1>
    <p style="color: white;">For the position of Intermediate C++/Unreal Game Developer I would need a qualification that is in a field related to software development such as computer science and software engineering.</p>
    <p style="color: white;">Since CerebralFix uses Unreal Engine to develop their games, I am required to know the programming language C++ as it is used in Unreal Engine.</p>
    <p style="color: white;">Unreal Engine is very complicated as it has a plethora of features so extensive knowledge, experience and good technical skills on the engine is required.</p>
    <p style="color: white;">As for soft skills, I would need to have good communication skills and experience in working with a team of other programmers.</p>
    <h1 style="color: white;">Skills I have</h1>
    <p style="color: white;">I am in semester one of my first year in Bachelors of IT, so I am far from qualified for the position. Currently, I have zero knowledge or experience with the programming language C++, but I have done a bit of Python and I have heard that learning another programming language is easier if I already know another. Unreal Engine is a gaming engine that I have never used before, and it is also one of the more complicated engines. This means that my skills and ability to use Unreal Engine is next to none. Although my art and writing skills are subpar, I believe I have a good imagination and creativity to come up with good stories, game mechanics and character designs.</p>
    <h1 style="color: white;">Learning Plan</h1>
    <p style="color: white;">I will first need to finish my Bachelors of IT course and then I will take a computer science course since that is one of the qualifications for this position. During my studies I will slowly teach myself C++ by watching free courses on YouTube. There is a YouTube channel called “freeCodeCamp.org” that I am interested in and they have a C++ course for beginners. According to quora, Unreal Engine is apparently very easy to learn as there are many tutorials on YouTube. Although I do not believe learning how to use Unreal Engine is “easy” , I will also learn the basics of Unreal Engine through YouTube during my studies. Once I have some idea on how to use Unreal Engine and the basics of C++, I will attempt to create simple games over the years  to give myself some experience.</p>

    <h1 style="font-size: 90px; color: white;">Personality Profile</h1>

    <h1 style="font-size: 20px; color: white;">Big Five</h1>
    <img src="Images/person 5.png"width="860" height="300" alt="">

    <h1 style="color: white;">What do the results of these tests mean to me?</h1>
    <p style="color: white;">According to both the Myers-Brigs test and the Big Five test, I am an extrovert person which I agree with. I love talking to people however I have bad social skills, which is why many of my friends would think I am an introvert. I am a “turbulent debater type” according to Myers-Brigs which means that I am highly self conscious and sensitive to stress. Being a “debater” means that I am a quick thinker, very knowledgeable, an excellent brainstormer and very energetic. This to me is partly true because I would not consider myself a quick thinker. It takes me a lot of time to come up with a good idea and I do not have the confidence to throw out an idea the moment I think of one before evaluating that idea in my head first. The Big Five test results follow this up with a low score in emotional stability. I would say that this is accurate since I am very bad at managing stress and I can get easily overwhelmed with negative emotions, especially stress and anxiety.</p>
    <p style="color: white;">The results of the Learning Style show that my learning style is more leaning towards the “Kinesthetic style”. This means that I learn by experiencing things and being more hands-on. I think this accurately describes me the most because the other three learning styles are “Visual Learning” and “Auditory Learning.” I have a very short attention span, especially when I am alone. I find myself exhausted and unmotivated after an extended amount of time reading a textbook, looking at a diagram or listening to someone talk. However all of this is less apparent if I am with a group.</p>
    <h1 style="color: white;">How do I think these results may influence my behaviour in a team?</h1>
    <p style="color: white;">I think that I work best in a team because when I am working by myself, I get exhausted after an extended period of time. This is because I am an extrovert and I gain my energy by being with other people. I am a very agreeable and cooperative person according to the Big Five test. I am able to work with others, I will do any task that is assigned to me  and more often than not, I am okay with putting others ideas first even if I think my idea is better. However, I am labelled a “turbulent” person by the Meyers-Brigs test, meaning I might get overwhelmed with pressure and anxiety when working with a group as I am expected to fulfil my role well.</p>
    <h1 style="color: white;">How should I take this into account when forming a team?</h1>
    <p style="color: white;">Knowing that I am easily overwhelmed and sensitive to stress, I think I will want to group with down to earth and patient people. This way I would not be under as much pressure and thus less likely to be stressed. I am relatively new to IT and because I struggle to learn things through visual and audio means, I  would need to group with people who are already knowledgeable and experienced in IT so that they can explain certain concepts to me much easier than someone with less knowledge and experience. There are not many opportunities for me to learn things by experiencing things, other than people walking me through the processes of developing the project, so I would need the person who is best at explaining certain concepts.</p>

    <h1 style="font-size: 90px; color: white;">Project Idea</h1>
    <h1 style="color: white;">Overview</h1>
    <p style="color: white;">My project is a mobile app that simulates playing with cards. It is meant to be played with a bunch of friends. The player who starts a game using the app is the dealer and players can join the game via a code. The game will have a table viewed from the top looking down and a classic deck of 52 cards. Cards can be dealt to each player automatically and players can drag and drop their cards wherever they want on the table and in any orientation (face up, face down, tilted and ect).</p>
    <h1 style="color: white;">Motivation</h1>
    <p style="color: white;">As I have said in "About Me", I love playing video games and playing tabletop games and card games. I want to make something that combines both my love video games and tabletop/card games. Whenever I’m at a party, either me or my friends would ask, “do any of you bring cards?” and so I aim to create an app that allows people to play cards anywhere and anytime they want. There are many mobile card games involving a standard pack of 52 cards such as solitaire, poker and ect, however they all have fixed rules. I have noticed that when people play card games, they tend to play slightly modified versions with “house rules." This game allows players to play cards however they want.</p>
    <h1 style="color: white;">Description</h1>
    <p style="color: white;">The app is a mobile game let’s players play with a standard deck of 52 cards. When the app is opened, there will be a “Start Game” button, a “Join Game” button, a “Decks” button and a “Shop” button.</p>
    <p style="color: white;">Pressing on the “Deck” button will open up an inventory of all the different decks a player has. All the decks will be standard 52 decks, but they’ll be in different styles and aesthetics. Each player will start with one deck in the classic, regular style and as they play games, they earn coins to buy different style decks in the shop.</p>
    <p style="color: white;">The person who starts the game is the dealer and other people can join the game by pressing “Join Game” and entering a code provided by the dealer similar to Kahoot.</p>
    <p style="color: white;">Once a game starts, there will be a table viewed from the top looking down surrounded by icons of several provided avatars which represents the players.</p>
    <p style="color: white;">The dealer can deal cards to all the players, they can allocate and distribute the cards however they want. Tapping on the icons will show how many cards that player has and that player is able to decide whether they wish to reveal any of their cards or not. Players can drag and drop cards anywhere they want on the table and in any orientation whether it is face up, face down, tilted and ect. This allows players to play any type of card games however they like. Players can return cards back to the deck through dragging and dropping them into the deck. There is a reset button that returns all cards back to the dealer and a shuffle button which randomly shuffles the deck. The shuffle button will only shuffle cards in the deck that have not been dealt to players.</p>
    <p style="color: white;">When players drag and move cards around, other players will not be able to see that card move around until the card is dropped on a new location in which then other players will see an animation of that card sliding to its new location. When players drag a card to another card, it will be stacked on top.</p>
    <p style="color: white;">The maximum number of players will be 10 since the game, although can be played on a larger device, is intended to be played on a phone which has a small screen that may not fit all the icons representing the players.</p>
    <h1 style="color: white;">Tools and Technology</h1>
    <p style="color: white;">I will be using a game engine to create my project. There are many game making engines for me to use and I believe the two best ones to use for my project are Unity and Godot. Game engines make game development much easier as it provides many built in features such as physics, 3d rendering and collision detection. This way developers can focus more on mechanics of the game instead of starting from scratch, although a bit of coding will be required.</p>
    <p style="color: white;">Unity is one of the most popular game engines. As long as I earn less than 100k in the past 12 months, Unity is free to use. It specialises in making 3d games but can also make 2d games. Although not as complex and difficult to use as other game engines such as Unreal Engine, Unity still has a large learning curve. There are many features in Unity and while it allows high quality games to be made, it can be very challenging to learn all the features. I would have to learn a new programming language, C#.</p>
    <p style="color: white;">Godot is another option I can use, and although not as good as Unity, it is free and open source. Godot is also easier to learn and use than Unity as you code using GDScript which is simpler than the language used in Unity (C#). Godot specialises in smaller 2d games which is what my project is.</p>
    <p style="color: white;">Both Godot and Unity can run on Windows 10 which I have and I will be using my PC to run one of these game engines.</p>
    <h1 style="color: white;">Skills Required</h1>
    <p style="color: white;">Currently I do not possess the skills to create a game on Unity or Godot as I do not know the programing language C# or GDScript. Unity has a lot of features which will be challenging to learn them all, however Unity does have lots of support and learning guides and tutorials. Godot is a lot easier to use since GDScript is a lot easier than C# and is “Python-like” which is a language that I am currently learning in the subject Introduction to Programming. Godot also has less features making it beginner friendly. This makes developing a simple game using Godot relatively feasible.</p>
    <h1 style="color: white;">Outcome</h1>
    <p style="color: white;">If this project is successful, the outcome would be a fun mobile app that allows people to play with cards anywhere and anytime. Card games are limited in whether there is a table/space to play on and whether people actually bought cards with them. This app would negate those limitations as you do not need a flat space such as a table to put cards on or a real physical deck of cards. This development would not have a very big impact because at the end of the day, if people had the option to choose between a physical deck of cards versus a digital one, they would most likely choose the physical deck every time. This app is meant to be something small and casual and something to play with some friends on a train, at a picnic/BBQ and ect.</p>
